# Asthma pathophisiology - genetics

- There are 60% of hereditariety
- Mutiples genetic and environmental factors
- Differents genes act in the phenotipic expression
- The main factors have relation with type I hipersensibility, acute or chronic inflamation of the airways and hiper-responsivity to stimuli
- Main genetic loci: 5q, with genes *IL13*(athopic asthma), *CD14* (labor asthma), *HLA-II*(IgE production), ÃŸ-2-adrenergic receptor gene and IL-4 receptor gene (atopy, seric IgE and asthma); 20q, with gene *ADAM-33* (bhrocic smooth muscle and fibroblast proliferation)
