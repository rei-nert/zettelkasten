# Properties of a function
*Definition:* f: X->Y is surjective if every single element of Y is mapped to at least once.  
*Definition:* f: X->Y is injective if every single element of Y is mapped to at most once.  
*Definition:* f: X->Y is byective if every element of Y is mapped exactly once.  
*Definition:* Byective is injective and surjective.
