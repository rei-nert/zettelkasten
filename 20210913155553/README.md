# Proof

*Definition:* Method to ascertaining the truth  
A *mathematical proof* is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.  

## Proposition
A statement that is either true or false.

## Predicate
A preposition where truth depends on the value of variable(s)

## Implication
p=>q is true if p is false or q is true

## Axiom
A proposition that is assumed is true  
- They should be 
  1. consistent 
  1. complete  
- A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false.  
- A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is true or false.
