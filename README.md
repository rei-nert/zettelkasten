# My colections of zettlekasten in markdown format.

Welcome to my zettlekasten. I'm using github as a place to store them, mainly because I can search and interact easily with them.  
Their index are the current time of the creation of the note in YYYYmmDDHHMMSS (Year Month Day Hour Minutes Seconds) in UTC.  
All code is under the MIT License (LICENSE file) and all non-code (everything that isn't code) is under CC-BY-ND (LICENSE2 file).  
The main reason to use CC-BY-ND is to avoid modification of my thoughts and words, creating confusion of ambiguity.  
----
I'm mainly using it in my math, CS and medical studies, but I'll use it in my linguistic/language learning too.  
You can read and learn as much as you want.  
Feel free to explore my mind and my learning process.
