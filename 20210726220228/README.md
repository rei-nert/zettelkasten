# Asthma - Physiologic alterations

The airway obstruction by smooth muscle constraction, thickeness of airways' epithelium or free liquid in airways' lumen incress the air flow resistence, generating an incressed Lung Vascular Resistance (LVR) and decressed flow speed.  
In the beginning of an asthmatic crisis, there's obstruction in all levels of the airways, reverted after the crisis' regression.  
There's no alteration in the primary pression-volume curve.  
In an acute asthmatic crisis, the airways narrowing can be severe enough to close the airways, closing every individual pulmonary unit and alterating the volume-pression curve. There's also reduction of the elastic retraction, decressing the expiration flow rates.  
There's a drop in pleural pression during inspiration, being below the atmospheric pression.  
The expiration is active, with the person forcing the air exit, and gerating a maximum pleural pression of 20-30 cmH2O above the atmospheric pression.  
Therefore, there's high respiratory frequency, generated by intrapulmonary receptors stimuli, with central respiratory effects.  
There's arterial hypoxemia and hypocapnia due to hyperpneia.
