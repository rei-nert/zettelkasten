# Changed from ZSH to Bash

My ZSH file was taking an eternity to load, so I decided to test Bash again to see how it is.  
By now, the only thing that I miss is the TAB autocompletion on ZSH, and, also, my PS1 is a little bit off in bash (I get it from rwxrob)  
But my login is almost instantanious.
