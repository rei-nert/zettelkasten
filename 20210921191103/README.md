# Tournament graph
Either u beats v: u->v; or v beats u: v->u.  
*Definition:* A directed Hamiltonian path is a directed walk that visits every vertex exactly once.  
*Theorem:* Every tournament graph contains a directed Hamiltonian path.  
The node u virtually "win" v, for u, v and w, if u->w->v.  
*Theorem:* The highest degree is the "winner".
