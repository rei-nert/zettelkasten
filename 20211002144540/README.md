# Introduction to Probability
*Definition:* The sample space for an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.  
*Definition:* an outcome  (aka sample point) consists of all the information about the experiment, after it has been performed, including all random choices.  
*Definition:* an outcome of the Monty Hall Game when the contestant switches consists of: 
1. Box with prize.  
1. Box chosen first.  
1. Box revealed.  
*Definition:* A probability space consists of a sample space and a probability function Pv: S-> ℝ, such that 
1. ∀ ω∈S, 0<=P(ω)<=1  
1. ∑ω∈S Pr(ω) = 1    
*Interpretation:* ∀ ω∈S, Pr(ω) = probability that ω will be the outcome.    
*Definition:* An event is a subset of the sample space.  
*Definition:* The probability that an event E ⊆S occurs is ∑ω∈S Pr(ω).
