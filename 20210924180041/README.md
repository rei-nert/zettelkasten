# Total order

*Definition:* A total order is a partial order in which every pair of elements is comparable.  
*Definition:* A total order is consistant with a partial order is called a topological sort.   
*Definition:* A topological sort of a poset (A, ≤) is a total order (A, ≤t) such that ≤ ⊆ ≤t.  
*Theorem:* Every finite poset has a topological sort.  
*Definition:* A chain is a sequence of distinct elements, such that a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ at, with t being the length of the chain.
