# Curve Sketching general strategies
1. Plot
    1. Discontinuities(especially infinite)
    1. Endpoints(x -> +/- infinite)
    1. Easy points (optimal)
1. Second
    1. Solve f'(x)=0
    1. Plot critical points and values
1. Decide wheter f' is <0 or >0 on each interval between crital points/discontinuities (consistent with steps 1 & 2)
1. f" is >0 or <0 for concave up/down, f"(x0) = 0 <=> inflection point
1. Combine
