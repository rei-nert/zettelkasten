# Inhormogeneous recurrence
f(n)-a1f(n-1)-...adf(n-d) = g(n)  
Step 1: Replace g(n) by 0 and solve the homogeneous recurrence, ignoring the boundary conditions.  
Step 2: Restore g(n) and find any particular solutions, ignoring boundary conditions.  
Step 3: Add the homogeneous and particular solutions together and use the boundary conditions to determine constant factors.
