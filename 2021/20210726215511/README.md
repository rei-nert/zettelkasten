# Acute asthmatic response mediators
- Aceticolin: Release by intrapulmonar motor nervi, with direct stimulus to M8 subtype muscarinics receptors, creating smooth muscle constriction of the airways.  
- Histamin: powerful bronchoactive endogenous, mainly, in the lungs, by mastocytes
- Leukotriens and lipoxins: leukotriens (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, LTB4) are derivated of the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid of cell membrane phospolipids in the cell activation by mastocytes and eosinophils. LTC4 and LTD4 are powerful agonis for smooth muscle constraction in the airways.
- NO: produced by airways' epithelial cells and inflamatory cells, being a brochodilator with homeostatic function.
