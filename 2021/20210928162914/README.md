# Linear Recurrence
*Definition:* A recurrence is linear if it is of the form f(n) = a1.f(n-1)+ a2.f(n-2) + ... + ad.f(n-d) = âˆ‘i-1->d aif(n-d) for fixed constants ai,d, and d is the order of the recurrence.  
*Fact:* If f(n) = a^n and f(n) = a2^n are solutions to a linear recurrence (without boundary conditions), then f(n) = c1a1^n+ c2a2^n is also a solution for any constants c1 and c2.
