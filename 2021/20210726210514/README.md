# Asthma classification

Asthma can be classified as atopic (allergenic sensibilization) and non-atopic.  
Both types can generate bronchospasm due to many mechanism, like respiratory infections, environment irritating exposition, cold ar, stress and exercice.  
There are different patterns of inflamation: eosinophils, neutrophils, mix and pauer granulocytes. These subtypes are different in ethiology, imunopathology and treatment.
## Asthma atopic
Most commom type of asthma, with start in childhood and being a classic example of type I hipersensibility reaction, created by IgE.  
Atopic history is commom.
Frequently, asthmatic crisis occurs after allergic rinitis, urticaria or eczema.  
Created by environment antigens (e.g. dust, polen, animal fur, food) and infections.  
Cutaneous test with allergenic generate immediate papuloeritematose reaction.  

## Asthma non-atopic
No evidencies of allergenic sensibilization with negative cutaneous test. Familir history of asthma is less commom.
Common stimuli are viral respiratory infections (e.g. rinovirus, parainfluenza) and inhalatory air pollution (e.g. SO2, O3, NO2).
The viral mucosa inflamation reduces the tolerance limit of the vagal subepithelial receptors.
Humoral and cell mediators of air obstruction are similar to atopic asthma and they have the same treatment.  

## Drug induced asthma
Many drugs can lead to asthma, like AAS, with recurring signs of rinitis and nasal polypus, urticaria and bronchospasm.  
The mechanism is unknow, likely being due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase pathway of arachiidonic acid metabolism, without effect in the lipoxygenase pathway and with changes in leukotrienes production.  

## Labor asthma
Labor asthma has stimuli due to steam, chemical and organic polders, gases and other chemical compounds, with the episodes happening after repited exposure to the antigens.
