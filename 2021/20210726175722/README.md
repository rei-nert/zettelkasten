# Asthma pathophysiology

- Edema and hiperemia of mucosa
- Infiltration of mastocyte, linphocytes Th2, CD1d-only NK cells and eosinophils
- Conservation of the receptor
- Production of IgE
- Th2 cells are critical to the patogenesis, because of the excessive response to environmental antigens, producing IL-4 (IgE stimuli production), IL-5 (eosinophils activation) and IL-13 (mucus and IgE production by B cells)
- IgE covers submucosa's mastocytes, with degranulation after allergic exposure
  - Two reations waves: early and late
	- Early reaction have bronchocontriction (due to direct stimulus of ephitelial vagal receptors), elevation of mucus production and variable vasodilatation
	- Late reaction is inflamation due to eosinophils, neutrophils and T cells activation
    - Epitelial cells stimulus to produce chemokines (e.g. eotaxine, RANTES, MIP1-Î±, IL-8) by ephitelial and inflamatory cells, losing T-bet, T cells signer, creating an amplification and perpetuation of airway inflamatory action
- Inflamatory response thick the airway walls due to type III and V collagen deposit bellow the true basal membrane, in a airway remodelling.
- In a severe asthmatic event, there's an evident thickeness of airways wall, with focal oclusion of the airways, due to hiper viscous mucus and flaked epitelial cells
  - This generate airways' lumen obstruction to air flow
- The airways' obstruction is due to smooth muscle contraction, epithelial thickeness and liquid in airways' lumen
