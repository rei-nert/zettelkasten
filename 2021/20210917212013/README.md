# Matching graph

*Definition:* Give graph G=(V,E), a matching is a subgraph of G, where every node has degree 1.
*Definition:* A matching is perfect if it has size |V|/2.  
*Definition:* The weight of a matching M is the sum of the weights on the edges in M.  
*Definition:* A minimal weight matching for G is a perfect matching for G with the minimal weight.  
*Definition:* Given a matching M, x and y form a rogue couple if they prefer each other to their mates in M.  
*Definition:* A matching is stable if there are no rogue couples.  
*Goal:* Find a perfect matching that is stable.
