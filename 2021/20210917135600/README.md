# Graph theory

*Definition:* A graph G is a pair of sets (V,E), where V is a nonempty set of items called vertices or nodes, and E is a set of 2-item subsets of V called edges.  
*Definition:* Two nodes xi and xg are adjacent if they connected by an edge ({xi, xg} âˆˆ E)  
*Definition:* An edge e = {xi, xg} is incident to xi and xg.  
*Definition:* The number of edges incident to a node is the degree of a node.  
*Definition:* A graph is simple if it has no loops or multiple edges.
