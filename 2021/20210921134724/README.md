# Directed Graph (Digraphs)

v1(tail) -> v3 (head).  

*Theorem:* Let G = (V, E) be an n-node graph with V = {v1,..., vn}, let A = {aij} denote the adjency matrix for G. That is aij = { 1 if vi -> vj is an edge or 0 otherwise}.  

*Definition:* A digraph G = (V, E) is strongly connected if for all u,v ∈ V, ∃ directed path from u to v in G.  
*Definition:* A directed graph is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG) if it does not contain any directed cycles.
