# Relations

*Definition:* A relation from a set A to a set B is a subset R ⊆ AxB  
*Definition:* A relation on A is a subset R ⊆ AxA  
*Properties:*  
A relation R on A is:  
- Reflexive: if xRx for all x∊A  
- Symmetric: if xRy => yRx for all x, y ∊ A  
- Anti-symmetric: if xRy ∧ yRx => x=y  
- Transitivity: if xRy ∧ yRz => xRz  
*Equivalence relation:* A reflexive, symmetric and transitive relation.  
*Partial orders:* A reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive relation.  
*Equivalence class*: x∈A is the set of all elements in A related to x by R, denoted [x]. [x]= {y: xRy}
