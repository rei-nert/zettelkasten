# Differential equations

dy/dx = f(x)  
y = ∫f(x)dx  
- Only methods to find antiderivativies: substitution or advanced guessing.  
- (d/dx + x)yi =0  => () being the annihilation operator.  
		1. dy/dx = -xy (Multipling by y)  
		1. dy/y = -xdx (Dividing by y and multiplying by dx)  
		1. ∫dy/y = - ∫xdx (Leibniz notation of antiderivativies)  
		1. ln y = -x²/2 + c (Antiderivatives)
		1. e^ln y = e^(-x²/2 + c) (Exponatiate to express in terms of x)
		1. y = Ae^(-x²/2) => A = e^c
		1. y = ae^(-x²/2) any a
