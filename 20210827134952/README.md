# Solids of revolution

Revolve around x-axis  
Width dx => Disk/Wheel  

## Method 1: method of disks
- Area = πy²; dV = πy²dx  

## Method 2: Method of Shells
- Revolved around the y-axis
- Thickness = dx
- Height = a-y (y=f(x))
- Circunference = 2πx
- dV = (2πx)(a-y)dx = 2π(ax-x³)dx (in y = x²)
- V = ∫0->√a 2π(ax-x³)dx
