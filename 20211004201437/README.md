# Independence - Probability
*Definition:* An event A is independent of an event B if: Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) or if Pr(B) = 0.  
*Theorem: Product Rule for Independent Events* If A is independent of B, then Pr(A∧B) = Pr(A).Pr(B).  
*Theorem: Symmetry of Independence* If A is independent of B, then B is independent of A.  
*Definition:* Events A1, A2, ..., An are mutually independent, if ∀i and ∀J ⊆ [1, n]-{i}, Pr(Ai|∩i∈J Ai) = Pr(Ai) or Pr(∩i∈J Ai) = 0.  
*Product Rule Definition of Mutually Independence:* A1, A2, ..., An are mutually independent if ∀J⊆[1,n], Pr(∩i∈J Ai) = πi∈J Pr(Ai).  
*Definition:* Events A1, A2, ..., An are pairwise independent if ∀i,j(i=\=j), Ai and Aj are independent.
