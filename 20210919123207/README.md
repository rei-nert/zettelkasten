# Walks and Paths - Graph Theory

*Definition:* A walk is a sequence of vertices connected by edge.  
*Definition:* A path is a walk where all vi's are different.  

## Connectivity

*Definition:* u and v are connected if there is a path from u to v.  
*Definition:* A graph is connected when every pair of vertices are connected.  

## Cycles and Closed Walks
*Definition:* A closed walk is a walk with start and ends at the same vertex.  
*Definition:* In a closed walk, if k>= 3 and v0, v1, ..., vk-1 are all different, then it is called cycle.  

## Tree
*Definition:* A connected and acyclic graph is called a tree.  
*Definition:* A leaf is a node with degree 1 in a tree.
